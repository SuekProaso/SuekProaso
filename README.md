# SuekProaso
SuekProaso, yes, it's like ... Well let's start from the beginning SuekProaso is a hacker from spain dedicated to computer art and was born in 2003. At age 3 I tried his first pc game, it was spore. A game that consisted of conquering worlds and creating your own species. Then I started to play the famous saga Counter Strike at 4 years and at 5 years without opening the bios, almost fucking pc but before his father caught it. Then he started playing the sims. As a gta but without violence xD. And at the age of 6 he started programming arduino boards. At 8 years old with a good knowledge of programming with c, I was in a job for what his parents punished him. At the age of 11 he started again, without doing strange things, with precision and with safety. I knew a lot of people who liked informatica but none was worth because many were bored, others did not know anything, etc., etc. But at the age of 13, I met the perfect friend who, with only 13 years went to a McDonald's, took a laptop with KaliLinux and they connected to the public network and they made a xplozitz and they acceded to the accounts of the people, like intsgram, facebook , Gmail etc ...
